Hello team, 
i have given the blind spot architecture of the Deploying Application on the AWS cloud using Monolithic server, 
Due to insufficient network utility i was not able to build an server. but made an attempt to express how the application deploys from cloud to App.
Including to all files i have added in additionally the extra commands to aware propaganda of the job.
But the Selectal of the cloud deployment will works arranging order of deployment on the source code 
like:
step1: AWS cloud with monolithic server
step2: IAM roles and polices
Step3: Build ELB and Auto-Scaling
Step4: Github Source code 
Step5: pull the request from jira 
Step6: jenkins build with essential source like Java, Maven, other following tools
step7: install Sonarqube
Step8: Install docker, terraform as (IaC)
Step9: manage jenkins plugins and tools security for application build
step10: test and validate with QA team 
step11: finally once succeeded pushed to clients server for realtime.
these are the following steps for a realtime deploying a code...

Thank you...
