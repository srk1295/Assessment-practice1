Deploying an Application on AWS cloud:
=====================================

Application type web app, mobile app, desktop app, etc.,

however here is a general outline for deploying an application in AWS

prepare an application
ensure all code, dependencies and resources are bundled together. consider containerization with docker or a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
Configure Environment variables: define database connections, API keys and other setting specific to your AWS environment. Store them securely using AWS secrets Manager.
Version your application: implement a version control system like git to track changes and enable rollbacks if needed.

Choose an Deployment method:
Manual: infrastrucrure, create and configure resource like EC2 instance, security groups and load balancers.

Set an AWS environment:
Create an AWS account,
Configure security settings: Set up IAM roles for access control, VPCs for network isolation and security groups for Instances restrictions.
Allocate resources: choose the appropriate EC2 instance type, ECS cluster configuration, or Lambda function memory and timeout based on your application's requirments.

Deploy your applications:
Manula deployment: Launch EC2 instances, install dependencies, configure an application and start it.

Monitor and manage Application:
CloudWatch: monitor an application health, performance metrics and logs, set up alarms for critical events.
Auto Scaling Automatically adjust a resources (EC2 instances, Lambda functions) based on Traffic demands, optimizing cost and performance.
Updates and maintenance: implement a CICD pipeline for automated deployments and updates, Regularly patch dependencies and perform security scans.
